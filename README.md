## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Transformer-based model. The model is trained on historical stock price data and various technical indicators to improve its accuracy. The technical indicators include Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

## Technical Indicators

The following technical indicators are calculated and used as features for the model:
- **Bollinger Bands**: Measures market volatility.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Identifies overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Indicates potential trend reversals.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Shows the relationship between two moving averages.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Highlights the direction of the trend.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `ta`
- `torch`
- `torchsummary`
- `matplotlib`
- `tqdm`
- `torchviz`

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ta torch torchsummary matplotlib tqdm torchviz
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook stock_price_prediction.ipynb
    ```

2. **Run the notebook**:
    Execute the cells in the notebook to load data, compute technical indicators, train the Transformer model, and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow.
- `q1_filtered_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model (you may need to update the path to your dataset).

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the model's performance, including plots comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices for both training and validation datasets. Performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 are also calculated and displayed.
